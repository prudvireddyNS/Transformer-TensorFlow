# Transformer Architecture in TensorFlow

This repository contains an implementation of the Transformer architecture in TensorFlow from the paper ["Attention is all you need"](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf).



## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prudvireddyNS/Transformer-TensorFlow.git
   cd Transformer-TensorFlow
   
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Credits
This project was inspired by the tutorials from the YouTube channel [CodeEmporium](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTl9hO2Oobd97qfWC40gOSU8C0iu0m2l4&si=qpevuXStP7JIBDx9). Although the tutorials were taught in PyTorch, the theory and explanations provided were incredibly valuable. I have implemented the Transformer architecture in TensorFlow based on the concepts learned from this channel. Be sure to check out their channel for more in-depth tutorials on machine learning and deep learning topics.
